# Problem 1

Here’s a short description of the dataset via R codes:

    ## 
    ## The downloaded binary packages are in
    ##  /var/folders/d8/lq84dmfs4zzf2_02b4602_c00000gn/T//RtmpzWEObh/downloaded_packages

This “early_january_weather” dataset contains 15 variables: origin,
year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. For variable “temp”, the
mean value is 39.5821229 and the SD is 7.058637 . For variable “humid”,
the mean value is 65.4767039 and the SD is 18.9453049 . For variable
“wind_speed”, the mean value is 8.2258269 and the SD is 4.6116356.

This dataset has a total of 358 rows and 15 columns. The mean
temperature is approximately 39.5821229 degrees.

A scatterplot was created to display the relationship between
temperature and time hour, with humidity levels. As the time increases,
the temperature increases, and the humidity level reached maximum around
Jan. 14th. Then, the scatterplot was exported to the project directory
as “scatterplot.png”.

# Problem 2

After caculating the mean value of each variable in the dataframe, the
ran_size and log_vector have mean values, but the chara_vector and
vec_factor have not.

When converting the \`log_vector\` to numeric values, only have 0
(FALSE), 1 (TRUE), and NAs (missing values).

When converting the \`chara_vector\` to numeric values, the results are
NAs since the string characters cannot be interpreted as valid numbers.

When converting the \`vec_factor\` to numeric values, the 4 levels have
been converted to 1, 2, 3, and 4. This number represents the levels of
the factor but meaningless in numeric level.

``` r
# Create a data frame
example_df <- tibble(
  ran_size = rnorm(10),
  log_vector = rnorm(10) > 0,  
  chara_vector = c("My", "name", "is", "Tara", "Zhan", "and", "nice", "to", "meet", "you"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("elder", "elder", "elder", "adult", "adult", "adult", "adult", "children", "children", "children"))
)
#The mean of each variable
mean(pull(example_df, ran_size))
mean(pull(example_df, log_vector))       
mean(pull(example_df, chara_vector))  
mean(pull(example_df, vec_factor))        
#Convert variables to numeric
new_log_vector <- as.numeric(example_df$log_vector)
new_chara_vector <- as.numeric(example_df$chara_vector)
new_vec_factor <- as.numeric(example_df$vec_factor)
```
